I am a senior finance professional with over 17 years of experience in fixed income and foreign exchange structuring, sales, and client advisory businesses. I have built a strong reputation for helping clients find quantitative based solutions to difficult risk management problems. I have a history of building new businesses: I have built 2 structured note platforms in foreign exchange, a pension and endowment coverage business, and most recently a foreign exchange client risk advisory business. As the North American head of Credit Suisse’s Client Risk Advisory business, I authored several innovative research pieces around event driven positioning, volatility regimes, and tail risk hedging. I have helped some of Credit Suisse’s largest money manager clients develop solutions for third party restricted currency delivery, undertake sophisticated transaction cost analyses, implement currency share class hedging programs, and explore hedge optimization techniques. I developed a suite of analytics that helped Credit Suissse’s active hedge fund clients identify relative value in the foreign exchange options markets. I am extremely active with Carnegie Mellon University recruiting both at the graduate and undergraduate levels and was the team leader for the Passionate Alumni Program at Credit Suisse. I travel to the school frequently and have guest lectured at the Tepper School of Business.

The title of this site is a reference to modern statistics origins at the Guiness factory in Dublin, Ireland. In particular, the
work of [William Sealy Gosset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset), whose pen name "Student" is famous in the literature.  And of course my love of the beautiful brown liquid they produce. For those intereseted in the history of statistics and its
influence on modern science, I highly recommend David Salsburg's book [The Lady Tasting Tea.](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805071342/?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=7782417427&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2033946875574972504&hvpone=12.91&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&ref=pd_sl_7e3tmf0o8p_b)
