## Posting from the PC
This test post was done from my windows PC running VMWare with a Linux environment
installed. I can see that I'm flirting with going Linux full time as I haven't spent
much time setting up workflow from Windows. Still, probably nice to keep both operating
systems available. I must say, VMWare works REALLY well. If you are interested, you can
find the VMware free player download [here](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0).

The next exercise will be to create a post using a rake task with markdown written in 
R. I will also want to see how the website handles displaying .html files generated
form R. The slick thing would be to write a script that will go straight from R to 
web post with no additional steps.
